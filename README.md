- 👋 Hi, I’m @otterspacee
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Disney and Disney parks, coding (ofc), gaming, photography, reading, and hanging out with my friend and family
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python (in a class that I am obligated to take even thought I already learned most of python) and javascript (on my own) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I coded a lot of games and websites in high school. So far in college I have yet to make anything but I am always interested. I am quite creative and enjoy creating new things. 
- 📫 How to reach me discord(OtterSpace#0958)
